**Pallozio** is a collection data visualization scripts for [Scriptographer](http://scriptographer.org/).
It has been created for [DensityDesign Lab](http://www.densitydesign.org/) and used to produce static graphics during the last three years.

Scripts were created for specific tasks, and then generalized. The code is neither clean nor well written - but hey, it works (most of the time).

Some scripts have a UI to interact with, but most of them are intended to be imported in your code to simplify some operation - like reading and parsing data, create color scales, create patterns, and so on.

**Scriptographer** is no longer supported, and you need an outdated Adobe Illustrator version to use it, but some of the scripts are still useful.

For this reason we are now working on a new tool, **Raw**: http://raw.densitydesign.org/.

Meanwhile, i will upload here all the scripts that generates visual models not yet implemented in **Raw**.

## How to install

First, install Scriptographer:

It requires a dataset with three columns: the first one defining vertical steps,
the second defining flows, the third defining the flows size.

firts dataset line must contain columns headers.
