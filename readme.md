**Pallozio** is a collection of scripts to ease data visualization using [Scriptographer](http://scriptographer.org/).
It has been created by [DensityDesign Lab](http://www.densitydesign.org/) and used to produce static graphics during the last three years.

Scripts were created for specific tasks, and then generalized. The code is neither clean nor well written - but hey, it works (most of the time).
Some scripts have a UI to interact with, but most of them are intended to be imported in your code to simplify some operation - like reading and parsing data, create color scales, create patterns, and so on.
