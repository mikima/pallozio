**Pallozio** is a collection of scripts to ease data visualization using [Scriptographer](http://scriptographer.org/).
It has been created for [DensityDesign Lab](http://www.densitydesign.org/) and used to produce static graphics during the last three years.

Scripts were created for specific tasks, and then generalized. The code is neither clean nor well written - but hey, it works (most of the time).

Some scripts have a UI to interact with, but most of them are intended to be imported in your code to simplify some operation - like reading and parsing data, create color scales, create patterns, and so on.

**Scriptographer** is no longer supported, and you need an outdated Adobe Illustrator version to use it, but some of the scripts are still useful.

## How to install

Download the [master .zip file](https://github.com/mikima/pallozio/archive/master.zip), unzip it in your "Scriptographer Scripts" folder.

On OSX usually is in "/Users/{yourname}/Documents/Scriptographer Scripts".
